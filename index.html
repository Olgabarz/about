        <h3>Web Design and Product Sales</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code in high school when I was 12 years. Over the time, I focused on business marketing and I have gained a wealth of experience in products sales. During my professional path, I revitalized my passion for coding and my love for art that I express through web design and advertising.</p>

        <h3>Understanding other People's Behavior</h3>
        <p>But what is actually most important in life? I lived in the USA, Russia, and Australia. After getting to know a large number of people from different countries and cultures, I can understand and connect easier to people. After all, people matter the most to me - the strangers who become friends and the friends who become family. <br/> </p>
