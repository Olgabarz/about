        <h3>Web Design and Product Sales</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code in high school when I was 12 years. Over the time, I focused on business administrative tasks and I have gained a wealth of experience in selling products. During my professional path, I revitalized my passion for coding and my love for art that I express through web design.</p>

        <h3>Travel the World and Explore other Cultures</h3>
        <p>But what is actually most important in life? Being constantly curious and open for adventures, I have traveled and lived in the USA, Russia, and Australia. After all, people are most important in my life - friends and family. </p>
